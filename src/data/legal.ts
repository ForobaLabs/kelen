WHO WE ARE
The controller of your personal data is the organisation or individual operating this instance of Personal Finance HUB.
Contact: [COMPANY NAME / SUPPORT EMAIL — to be inserted before launch].

In self-hosted mode, the controller is the person running the server. This software project is the software supplier only.

WHAT DATA WE COLLECT AND WHY

Account and authentication data
What: Email address, display name, and security credentials (password stored as a one-way argon2 hash; multi-factor authentication secrets — TOTP, passkeys/WebAuthn, recovery codes).
Why: To create and manage your account, authenticate you across the suite, and protect your account.
Legal basis: Performance of a contract (GDPR art.6(1)(b)).

Household and goals data
What: Household configuration (shared-view settings with household members) and financial goals you set.
Why: To display your household's financial overview and track progress against your goals.
Legal basis: Performance of a contract.

Portfolio summary and market data
What: Aggregated portfolio data displayed in Kelen's dashboard (sourced from Naforo and Yiriba). Market data (public tickers, prices) fetched from public providers.
Why: To provide a unified financial overview.
Legal basis: Performance of a contract.
Note: Market data API calls carry only public ticker symbols — no personal data is transmitted to market data providers.

Security monitoring data
What: Login timestamps, failed-login counts, MFA attempt logs, and application error logs (pseudonymous — linked to your internal user ID). Error logs are captured by GlitchTip, which runs self-hosted on our server.
Why: To detect and prevent unauthorised access and protect the security of the suite.
Legal basis: Legitimate interests (GDPR art.6(1)(f)).

Transactional email
What: Your email address is used to send service-critical communications (MFA one-time codes, account security notifications).
Why: For account security and service operation.
Legal basis: Performance of a contract / legitimate interests.

HOW LONG WE KEEP YOUR DATA

Account data (profile, MFA secrets): retained while your account is active; deleted on account deletion.
Household and goal data: retained while account is active; deleted on account deletion.
Security / auth logs: 12 months from event.
Session and step-up tokens: deleted on logout or expiry (short-lived).
Account record: deleted within 30 days of account deletion.

When you delete your account, your personal data is removed from our live databases immediately. Because we keep encrypted backups on a 30-day rolling window, deleted data will be absent from all backups within 30 days of deletion.

WHO WE SHARE YOUR DATA WITH

OVH SAS — server hosting (France, EU). Databases are encrypted; OVH has no access to their content.
Enable Banking Oy — bank account connection (Finland, EU); only if you connect a bank.
Brevo SAS — transactional email (France, EU).
Paddle — merchant of record for paid subscriptions (receives your email, name and billing country at checkout); only if you subscribe.
Cloudflare — DNS, static websites, inbound email routing for our support addresses, and encrypted backup storage (R2, EU region).
GlitchTip error monitoring runs self-hosted on our own server — no data is sent to a third party.

AI providers — only if you opt in. By default AI features run on our own server with a local model and nothing is sent out. If you choose cloud AI for a feature, requests are processed by Cloudflare (Workers AI); if you add your own API key, requests go to the provider you pick (OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral, Google Gemini, OpenRouter or Cloudflare). We ask for your explicit consent first, which you can withdraw at any time in Settings; names, addresses, IBANs and similar identifiers are masked before sending, and providers may not train on your data. Your API keys are stored encrypted and never shown again.

We do not sell your personal data. We do not share your data with advertisers.

INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS
Your personal data is processed within the European Union. GlitchTip is self-hosted on our EU server. Cloudflare R2 backup storage uses an EU-region bucket.

Exceptions: if you opt in to cloud AI, masked prompts are processed by Cloudflare Workers AI (global edge network) or by the provider whose key you supply, which may be outside the EU (typically the US). Mail you send to our support addresses is routed through Cloudflare Email Routing. Where personal data leaves the EU, we rely on the provider's Standard Contractual Clauses or EU–US Data Privacy Framework certification.

COOKIES
We use two types of cookies, both strictly necessary:
• suite_session — authentication; keeps you logged in across all three apps (Kelen, Naforo, Yiriba).
• stepup_pazuru / stepup_tsumi — step-up authentication tokens, issued by Foroba and consumed by satellite apps for sensitive operations.
No advertising or analytics cookies are used.

YOUR RIGHTS
Under GDPR you have the right to: access your data (art.15); correct inaccurate data (art.16); delete your account and all associated data across the suite (art.17 — available directly in Settings → Security → Delete account); restrict processing (art.18); export your data (art.20 — CSV export available in Naforo); object to processing based on legitimate interests (art.21).

To exercise any right, contact: [SUPPORT EMAIL — to be inserted before launch].

You also have the right to lodge a complaint with your national data protection authority:
• France: CNIL (cnil.fr)
• Italy: Garante (garanteprivacy.it)

AGE RESTRICTION
This service is restricted to users aged 18 and older.

CHANGES TO THIS POLICY
We will notify you of material changes via in-app notification or email before the changes take effect.`,

NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE
Personal Finance HUB (Kelen, Naforo, Yiriba) is a personal finance management suite — it is not a financial adviser or regulated financial service (other than in relation to account information as addressed in our regulatory disclosures).

Market data, portfolio summaries, and any analytical outputs are for informational and organisational purposes only. Nothing in this service constitutes investment advice, financial advice, legal advice, or tax advice. Market data may be delayed and may not reflect real-time prices.

YOUR ACCOUNT
• You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials.
• You must enable multi-factor authentication as prompted during registration — this is mandatory for all accounts.
• You must not share your account with other people.
• Notify us immediately if you suspect unauthorised access to your account.

ACCOUNT DELETION
You may delete your account and all associated data at any time via Settings → Security → Delete account. Deletion is permanent and covers your data across all three apps (Kelen, Naforo, Yiriba). Bank connections (Enable Banking) are revoked immediately on deletion.

YOUR DATA
• You retain ownership of your personal financial data.
• We process your data as described in the Privacy Policy.
• You may export your data at any time (CSV export in Naforo).

SUITE ARCHITECTURE
Kelen acts as the authentication authority for the suite. Your login, MFA, and session tokens are issued by Foroba and shared with Naforo and Yiriba. Account management (password change, MFA settings, account deletion) is performed in Kelen and applies to the entire suite.

ACCEPTABLE USE
You must not use this service to: violate any applicable law or regulation; attempt to gain unauthorised access to other users' accounts or data; reverse-engineer or copy the software for commercial use.

SERVICE AVAILABILITY
We aim to provide reliable service but do not guarantee 100% uptime. We may perform maintenance that temporarily affects availability.

To the extent permitted by applicable law, we are not liable for decisions you make based on information provided by this service.

GOVERNING LAW
[USER ACTION: lawyer — governing law and jurisdiction clause to be completed before launch.]
